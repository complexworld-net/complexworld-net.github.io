  abstract  = "First recognized in 1665 by Christiaan Huygens, synchronization
               phenomena are abundant in science, nature, engineering and
               social life. Systems as diverse as clocks, singing crickets,
               cardiac pacemakers, firing neurons and applauding audiences
               exhibit a tendency to operate in synchrony. These phenomena are
               universal and can be understood within a common framework based
               on modern nonlinear dynamics. The first half of this book
               describes synchronization without formulae, and is based on
               qualitative intuitive ideas. The main effects are illustrated
               with experimental examples and figures, and the historical
               development is outlined. The remainder of the book presents the
               main effects of synchronization in a rigorous and systematic
               manner, describing classical results on synchronization of
               periodic oscillators, and recent developments in chaotic
               systems, large ensembles, and oscillatory media. This
               comprehensive book will be of interest to a broad audience, from
               graduate students to specialist researchers in physics, applied
               mathematics, engineering and natural sciences.",
